OKAY READ THIS ENTIRE FILE BEFORE RUNNING ANYTHING.

Before running the program at all, you need to go to voice.google.com. I am using their really good phone call software that is free to anyone with a gmail account. You will need to create a google voice account (click the sign in button at the top right of the page). Make sure you create your account and can sign in before running the program otherwise the program will not work.

To run this program you need to download the zip file, unzip the file, and open the terminal in the correct directory
All you need to do is type: 
    ./runPhoneCall.sh
A prompt will pop up in the terminal. Follow the directions. Make sure that when you are filling in your email and password that you fill everything in properly, otherwise the automatic login process will fail.*

* If you are concerned about the safety of your email account, it is stored inside of a text file in the program titled "CALLINFO.txt". You can delete this file after the program runs. However, your email information is entirely safe within this file, as there is no communication with any external sources inside the program aside from the google sign in.
